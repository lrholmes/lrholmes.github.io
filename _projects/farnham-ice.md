## Project Overview
Static one page website built for a small, local ice supply business.

Features:

* One Page design
* Responsive
* Logo/Brand design

### Logo Design
The client wanted something that would stand out amongst the competition, so after having researched other ice supply brands, I designed a modern and minimal logo that achieves this.
