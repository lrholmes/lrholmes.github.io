## Project Overview
The IBA Archive website is an online resource for researchers who are interested in media history. I designed and developed the website with Wordpress, ensuring that the content is easy to manage and update.

## Case Study

I recommended the use of Wordpress after having spoken to the client about the project requirements, and it turned out to be the perfect platform. Over 100 documents have already been added to the website by researchers, and it is easy for them to add more. Furthermore, all of the text elements of the website are fully customisable.

### Extending Wordpress
This website is not your traditional Wordpress blog, and it was very important to the client that it didn't look like a blog. Because of this, I had to change a lot of the default things that Wordpress does. One of the main decisions to achieve this was that I chose to present the posts in an easy to read and sortable table. Because there is no "*one way*" to view this kind of content, I felt that it was important to allow the user to choose the way that suits them. So the sorting feature that I implemented allows one to sort by any of the two dates (posted date for frequent viewers, and document date for a chronological ordering), and also by title. On top of this, you can of course choose to sort by Ascending or Descending order.
