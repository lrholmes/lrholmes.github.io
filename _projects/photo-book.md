## Project Overview

This project has been an amazing learning experience for me. When we started, I had no prior knowledge of developing for mobile devices, Swift, or Xcode, and now, at the end of the project, I feel like I can manage quite well. Through the process of developing this application I've noticed my skill-set becoming broader - I can now very quickly troubleshoot problems, and my ability to construct layouts in Xcode's Interface Builder is much stronger than when I started.

I found myself towards the end being able to implement new features rapidly, which I believe has contributed towards making the application that extra bit more interesting and useful (the font size feature being an example of this).
