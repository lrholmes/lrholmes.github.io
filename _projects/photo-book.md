  I lead the development of this iOS app, built to tie in with the Magna Carta exhibition at Salisbury Cathedral. The app was developed over the course of two months, using Apple's recently introduced programming language Swift, and Xcode.

## Project overview

For our final second year project we were provided a live brief, and asked to devise, design and develop an app for visitors to the [Magna Carta Exhibition at Salisbury Cathedral](http://www.salisburycathedral.org.uk/magna-carta "Magna Carta exhibition website").
In my group, we came up with Photo Book, an app that is designed to complement the photo-taking experience for visitors, by providing descriptions for each of the notable photo subjects. The idea behind this is that users will be able to look back at their photos from the exhibition, and see all of the relevant information about the subject of their photograph.

## My role
I developed the application from scratch using Swift and Xcode, learning a lot along the way. I had to learn and implement the following features:

* Scrolling navigation, to swipe through the app page by page
* Ability to jump to page from the home
* Integrating camera functionality to take photos in-app
* Accessing the device's gallery to import photos
* Sharing to Twitter

Those features were all a part of our initial plans for the application, but the client also requested some more features:

* Ability to theme the app (I introduced colour schemes and font-size options for this)
* Ability to reset the data
