>Tiltâ€“shift photography is the use of camera movements on small- and medium-format cameras, and sometimes specifically refers to the use of tilt for selective focus, often for simulating a miniature scene.

I had a blast making this tiltshift timelapse at Bournemouth Beach. [I love photography](https://500px.com/holmes){:target="_blank_"}, and I find that creating a timelapse is a challenging extension to photography. I added all of the tiltshift effects using **Adobe After Effects**, and edited the film together with **Adobe Premiere Pro**.
