### Hello.


Thanks for visiting my portfolio website. I'm Lawrence Holmes, a student at [Bournemouth University](http://bournemouth.ac.uk/){:target="_blank_"}, and currently on placement.

I **design** and **develop** for the web, using modern frontend technologies:

- **HTML5**
- **Sass/PostCSS**
- **Gulp/Webpack**
- **React**
- **JavaScript/ES2016**

I also work with backend technologies such as **PHP** with **SQL** and **NodeJS** with **MongoDB**.

I also have experience in **iOS development** with **Swift**.


Outside of design and development, I have a passion for **photography**. If you do too, or would like to see my work, then do check out my [500px page](https://500px.com/holmes){:target="_blank_"}.
